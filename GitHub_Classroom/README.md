# GitHub Classroom Setup

---
## GitHub
You will need a school-approved account at <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> which needs to comply to the following rules:
- The account handle should be *YourStudentId-LWHS* (i.e. *1234567-LWSD*).
- The email linked to the account should be your @lwsd.org email.
- The profile should have your correct *Name* filled in.
- It should have 2FA enabled, hooked into the Authenticator app on your phone.

If you already have a personal GitHub account which you want to use for school, you can configure it to comply to these rules but the recommendation is to create a new account.

## VSCode
- [ ] Check initial VSCode structure (should be opened in some *WorkFolder*, not  workspace).
- [ ] Configure **user.name** and **user.email** in git 
```
    > git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    > git config --global user.email Your@email
```

## GitHub Classroom
- [ ] Go to the <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/BbCcMPr6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assignment</a> link, find your name in the *Identifiers* list and click {*Accept this assignment*}.
- [ ] Open VSCode and clone the assignment repo (where to find it?)
	- [ ] Place *AssignmentFolder* under *WorkFolder*.
	- [ ] Check *AssignmentFolder* is in Classpath. If not present, add it.
